# hyf-repos-hooks

The purpose of this plain vanilla JavaScript application is to demonstrate how a simple version of **React hooks** might be implemented and used. It is intended for demonstration purposes only. This app does not use React or JSX. There is no virtual DOM. As a consequence, the required DOM manipulation is inefficient as DOM elements are created and destroyed repeatedly.

This application is a hooks-based implementation of the homework for the HYF JavaScript3 module. The hooks elements were inspired and build upon the work done by Shang Wang:

- [Getting Closure on Hooks (JSConf Edition)](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/react-hooks)

To install dependencies (only required to support ESLint):

```
npm install
```

To run the application, load the `src/index.html` in your browser.
